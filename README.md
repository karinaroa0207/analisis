# Systems Analysis Workshop – Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 Load Forecasting

## Overview
This repository contains the deliverables for the first workshop of the Systems Analysis course.  
The analysis is based on the closed Kaggle competition:  
[Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 - Load Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/global-energy-forecasting-competition-2012-load-forecasting)

The goal of the competition was to forecast hourly electricity demand for 20 geographical zones and the total aggregated system using historical load, weather data, and calendar information.


## Methodology
The analysis was carried out following the workshop guidelines:

1. **Competition Overview**  
   - Summary of the competition goal, dataset structure, and constraints.  

2. **Systems Analysis Report**  
   - **Systemic Analysis:** Identification of inputs, processes, outputs, and evaluation rules.  
   - **Complexity & Sensitivity:** Examination of constraints, variability, and system vulnerabilities.  
   - **Chaos and Randomness:** Discussion of nonlinear, unpredictable aspects of electricity demand.  
   - **Conclusion:** Key findings with strengths and weaknesses of the system.  

3. **Visual Representation**  
   - Diagrams created using LaTeX and TikZ to illustrate system architecture and data flow.  

## Tools Used
- **LaTeX** for writing the report.  
- **TikZ** for visual diagrams.
- **LucidChart** for visual diagrams.   
- **Kaggle competition page** as the primary data source.  

## Code
Minimal code was included, mainly for diagram generation and LaTeX formatting.  

## Final Report
The complete analysis is presented in the final PDF report.  

## Final Report

The complete analysis is presented in the final PDF report.
